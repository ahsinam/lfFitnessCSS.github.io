        Arpana Lama is a professional dancer and gymnast. Her passion for dance
        started early—she began taking dance classes in ninth grade. Eventually,
        Arpana joined Sushila Arts Academy, where she planned to study
        contemporary dance. However, her instructors were so impressed with her
        dancing that they encouraged her to study ballet instead. Since then,
        she has honed her ballet skills for almost eight years.

      <h2 id="stretching">What exaclty is stretching?</h2>
      <img src="./image/stretching.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        Stretching is an essential physical exercise that helps move the muscles
        and improve their elasticity. It can help people perform different tasks
        and sports efficiently by enhancing flexibility and elasticity. It
        offers several benefits, such as improved flexibility, reduced risk of
        injury, better posture, reduced muscle tension, and improved
        circulation.

      <h2 id="starting">How can one start?</h2>
      <img src="./image/yogastart.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        A person can start stretching anytime, but I prefer mornings. People
        should be clear about their limitations and how much their bodies can
        handle. Don&apos;t push your body too much, it can cause injury and
        muscle pain. A person who&apos;s just starting out should try the
        &apos;slow and steady&apos; technique. But before starting, make sure
        your stomach isn&apos;t very full. After having a heavy lunch or dinner,
        you need to wait for two to three hours, whereas if you&apos;ve eaten
        something light, you can wait for at least one hour.

      <h2 id="types">What are the different types of stretching?</h2>
      <img src="./image/stretchtype.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        Stretching helps increase athletic performance, improve general health,
        and eliminate pain and tension. There are three general types of
        stretching—static, dynamic, and ballistic. Static stretches are the most
        well-known and have been accepted as the standard practice for many
        years. But there are more effective methods for enhancing performance
        before exercise.Dynamic stretching is a type of active stretching that
        involves engaging the opposing muscle through the joint&apos;s range of
        motion.
